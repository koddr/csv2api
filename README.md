## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First, [download][go_download] and install **Go**. Version `1.20` (or higher)
is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go install`][go_install] command:

```console
go install github.com/koddr/csv2api@latest
```

> üí° Note: See the repository's [Release page][repo_releases_url], if you want
> to download a ready-made `deb`, `rpm`, `apk` or `Arch Linux` package.

GNU/Linux and macOS users available way to install via [Homebrew][brew_url]:

```console
# Tap a new formula:
brew tap koddr/tap

# Installation:
brew install koddr/tap/csv2api
```

Next, run `csv2api` with `-i` option to generate initial `config.yml` and 
`data.csv` files in the current dir:

```console
csv2api -i
```

Prepare your config and input data files:

- In your `config.yml`:
  - Make sure that the first column name in the `columns_order` section is a 
    primary key (PK) for your process.
  - Set up your API (base URL, token, endpoints, etc) in the `api` section.
  - Set up the filter for your fields in the `filter_columns` section.
  - Set up fields to be updated in the `update_fields` section.
- In your input `data.csv`:
  - Make sure that the first line of your CSV file contains the correct field names.

> üí° Note: See the repository's [Wiki][wiki_url] page to understand the
> structure of the config and input data files.

And now, run `csv2api` with options:

```console
csv2api \
  -c /path/to/config.yml \
  -d /path/to/data.csv \
  -e CONFIG
```

Done! üéâ Your transactions have been performed:

``` console
Hello and welcome to csv2api! üëã
